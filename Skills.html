    <h1>Skills</h1>
    <h2>HTML/CSS skills</h2>
    <p>If you hope to become a web developer, you must understand HTML and CSS. HTML is the most used markup language
        across
        the web, and web developers use it to create web pages on the Internet. CSS, on the other hand, is used to style
        the
        website. It's responsible for the choice of fonts, colors and layout in a website's design. Whereas HTML lays
        the
        foundation for a webpage, CSS styles it.</p>

    <h2>Analytical skills</h2>
    <p>As a web developer, you'll need to have keen analytical skills to create a variety of successful websites. This
        involves
        ensuring the coding is correct so the website is functional. Also, it's important to understand the needs of
        your
        customers or clients. You'll need to analyze their wants and needs and be ready to adapt to any changes they'd
        like
        to
        see implemented on the website. The better you understand your client, the better your website will turn out for
        them in
        the end.</p>

    <h2>Responsive design skills</h2>
    <p>If you work as a web developer, it's important to understand how responsive design works. Because many people
        view
        webpages both online and on their mobile devices, the websites you create need to adapt to the changing screen
        sizes. If
        your website isn't responsive, this means it won't be compatible with either the desktop site or the mobile
        site. In
        other words, it won't function or show up properly on either of these platforms. Your ability to create a
        responsive
        design can also impact the number of visitors a website gets since most people are deterred from a website when
        it's
        not
        displaying properly.
    </p>
    <h2>JavaScript skills</h2>
    <p>You'll also need to understand JavaScript as a web developer. JavaScript is a high-level programming language
        that
        implements complex features onto a website. This involves things like moving elements, search bars, videos or
        interactive maps on a webpage. In knowing JavaScript, you'll be able to meet higher expectations from your
        clients
        in
        the web development process. Using these skills, you'll be able to reel in more webpage viewers, as well, since
        the
        majority of people tend to prefer interactive web pages that grab their attention. Special features go a long
        way in
        engaging viewers, and your job as a web developer plays a large role in seeing them come to fruition on a
        digital
        screen.</p>

    <h2>Interpersonal skills</h2>
    <p>Since you'll be working with a variety of clients, you must have good interpersonal skills. This includes various
        social
        skills like good body language, active listening skills, the ability to collaborate and an overall good work
        ethic
        and
        positive attitude. The more you get along and can effectively communicate with your clients, the smoother the
        web
        development process will be for both of you.</p>

    <h2>Testing and debugging skills</h2>
    <p>As a web developer, it's important to know how to continuously test your webpage for any possible errors. Should
        any
        arise, you should also know how to debug it. Testing makes sure your coding is doing what it's supposed to and
        will
        come
        down to either functional testing or unit testing. Being able to consistently and effectively test and debug
        your
        webpage is essential in this role.</p>

    <h2>Back-end basics</h2>
    <p>You'll also need to understand some of the fundamentals of back-end web development. This is because you'll be
        working
        in collaboration with back-end developers or might be tasked with using these skills yourself. In this regard,
        you'll
        need to know how servers work as well as APIs, SQL, databases and cybersecurity. All of these are important
        skills
        to
        know as they relate to the server-side of a webpage.
    </p>
    <h2>Search engine optimization</h2>
    <p>As a web developer, you must know all about search engine optimization. This is because website traffic is
        becoming
        more
        and more important to companies. If a website has good SEO, it'll attract a greater number of webpage visitors
        by
        showing up high enough in search engine result pages. Because more and more companies are looking to have good
        SEO,
        it's
        an important skill to have as a web developer.</p>
